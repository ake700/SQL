# MySQL Guide and Examples

The intent of the markdown is to provide a guideline for SQL queries in the future.

Queries were performed using MySQL on public datasets from [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410002701) for changes in worker class employment between 1976-2021, and the [Vancouver's PD](https://vpd.ca/crime-statistics) crime statistics from 2015-2022.

Cleaned employment dataset was used to create an interactive dashboard using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alfred.ke/viz/StatsCanEmploymentv1/Dashboard1).
